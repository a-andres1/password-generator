# password-generator



Notes:

First things first, what is a Readonly id? Readonly means you can't modify the text in any way. So a readonly id makes it impossible for me to copy/paste from the password generator box. I assume that after we have generated the password we should be able to cut/paste things. 

The textarea tag is also new. Seems to be mostly used with forms to set a specific height/width and can contain an infinite amount of characters.
